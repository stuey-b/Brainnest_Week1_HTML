  <h2>Hiking</h2>
  <p>
    I also enjoy hiking and walking in nature. The Japanese countryside is very different
    to that found in England. There are a lot more mountains and a lot less field of green grass.
    One of my favourite places to hike is a place called 'Takedao'.  A railway track used to run 
    through here, so there are a number of abandoned tunnels to walk through that are pitch black. 
    The hiking trail also follows a river through the mountains which is beautiful.
