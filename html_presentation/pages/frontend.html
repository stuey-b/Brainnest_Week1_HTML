  <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
  <p>
    In 2022 I decided that I was going to change careers. I had always been intrigued by programming 
    but thought it would be too complicated. After learning about python and it's lovely syntax,
    I enrolled in an online course and began learning to code. Within this Python course there was a
    module about frontend development to give us something to look at whilst learnign to use Python
    on the backend. This is where I fell in love with frontend development and enrolled in another course
    focusing on that. I enjoy frontend development because it allows me to be creative, solve problems
    and it provides visual feedback. I'm currently working on a personal website.
