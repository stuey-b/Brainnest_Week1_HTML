  <h2>Hot Springs</h2>
  <p>
    Hot spring baths know as 'Onsen' are a big part of Japanese culture. It took me a few years
    of living here to pluck up the courage to enter one, but once I did I was hooked!
    If you visit these public baths, you can usually enjoy different types of relaxation treatments
    such as carbonated springs, saunas, bedrock baths and steam rooms.
