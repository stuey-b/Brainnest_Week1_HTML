  <h2>Music Production</h2>
   <p>
    I enjoy making  both instrumental music and vocal music. These days I
    mostly focus on remixes/covers of retro video game music, which I
    upload to my YouTube channel. I usually re-create songs in a lo-fi hip hop
    or synthwave style. Unfortunately I haven't uploaded in a while
    as I've been focusing on learning programming and frontend development, but
    have plans to release some of my remixes onto streaming platforms through
    a small record label soon.

    I'm also the composer for an upcoming video game called 'Goodlands'. This is a game 
    about dinos digging up dinos. I hope to take on more video game composer roles 
    in the future and have a goal to create my own game someday! Here are some of my
    favourite game soundtracks:

  <ul>
    <li>Chrono Trigger</li>
    <li>Donkey Kong Country</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
    <li>Fez</li>
    <li>Animal Crossing</li>
  </ul>
